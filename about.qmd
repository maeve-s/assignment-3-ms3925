This website will be about me learning and perfecting crochet! Here is some information about my experience so far:

-   I started crocheting in December 2025, with a Maeve the Duck Woobles kit

-   After the woobles kit, I worked on some smaller projects, like a cowboy hat for my cat and some leaf bookmarks

-   My current projects are a sunflower granny square bag and a cardigan
