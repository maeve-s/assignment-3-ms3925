This website will be about me learning and perfecting crochet! Here is some information about me:

-   I am currently a grad student at Cornell, but before this I did fieldwork in wildlife conservation

-   I started crocheting in December 2025, with a Maeve the Duck Woobles kit

-   After the woobles kit, I worked on some smaller projects, like a cowboy hat for my cat and some leaf bookmarks
