I am currently working on a cardigan, the pattern is called "Euphoria Cardi". My grandmother gave me the pattern and the yarn for it because she started it but never finished.

Caleb: I'm sadly not much of a crochet artist yet, but I can jot down some of my musical creations. I'm currently working on a song, in a Western theme, titled *Prairie Moon*, based on the Great Basin ecosystems of Oregon and Nevada.
